# üëã Hello, I'm David Atinga

I'm an applied economist with over 5 years of experience in applied research, impact evaluation, and consulting. My expertise lies in leveraging data-driven approaches to inform policy and development strategies, particularly within the agricultural sector. I have a strong background in Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Policy Analysis, where I apply advanced econometric techniques to tackle complex socio-economic issues.

## üî¨ What I Do

### **Research & Development**
I specialize in applied microeconomics, focusing on:
- **Project Evaluation:** Assessing the effectiveness and impact of development projects, with an emphasis on agricultural interventions and technology adoption.
- **Policy Analysis:** Evaluating policy frameworks to provide actionable insights that enhance economic outcomes for rural communities and smallholder farmers.

### **Survey Design & Data Management**
I have extensive experience in:
- **Designing Surveys:** Crafting surveys that accurately capture the socio-economic realities of target populations, particularly in developing regions.
- **Data Management & Analysis:** Ensuring the integrity and quality of data, utilizing tools like Stata, R, and SPSS to conduct rigorous statistical analysis and derive meaningful insights.

### **Program Evaluation**
Over the years, I've contributed to several international development projects, where I:
- **Evaluated Programs:** Conducted comprehensive evaluations to measure the success and sustainability of programs, offering recommendations for improvement.
- **Managed Field Teams:** Recruited, trained, and supervised field staff to ensure the accurate collection and analysis of data in challenging environments.

## üìö Academic Background
My academic journey reflects my commitment to advancing knowledge in economics and development:
- **PhD in Economics** | The University of Tokyo, Japan  
  Focus: Applied Microeconomics, Agricultural Development, and Policy Analysis.

  Focus: Agricultural Technology Adoption, Market Participation, and Resource Economics.
- **BA in Economics & Entrepreneurship Development** | University for Development Studies, Ghana  
  Focus: Economic Analysis, Entrepreneurship, and Development Studies.

## üìà Current Focus
My current research revolves around the intersection of climate change and agriculture:
- **Climate Change Impacts:** I am investigating how severe weather patterns affect agricultural productivity, with a focus on the decision-making processes of smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- **Technology Adoption:** Exploring the drivers and barriers to the adoption and disadoption of agricultural technologies in response to environmental challenges.
